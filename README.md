# Password-Controller ðŸ”‘

A password controller is a program that determines the strength of a password by evaluating its complexity. It can be used to ensure that a password is strong enough to protect against guessing or cracking attempts. The program may evaluate the password based on various factors, such as its length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and whether it has been previously compromised in a data breach. The password strength checker may provide feedback on the strength of the password and suggest ways to improve it if necessary.
